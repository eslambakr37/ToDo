## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid using Bootstrap-5.3
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I exploited this project to learn how to handle APIs by applying different requests (GET - POST - PUT - DELETE) so this project is linked with an API to save and show tasks.
Also I learned how to change the value of a variable in CSS root according to specific condition using JS.


### Continued development

The next step in this project will be allowing Drag and Drop option to reorder the list which has already been initialized but still needs ba able to reorder tasks in the DB.
